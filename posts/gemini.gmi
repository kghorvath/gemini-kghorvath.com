## I'm now in Geminispace
February 26, 2024

I've ported my website to the Gemini protocol. If you're not familiar with Gemini, it's an alternative protocol to HTTP, similar to the older Gopher protocol, that aims for simplicity.

You can find me at gemini://kghorvath.com using your favorite Gemini browser (Mine is Geopard).
